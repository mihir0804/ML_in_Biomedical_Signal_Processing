# Machine Learning in Biomedical Signal Processing

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and "Knowledge Check" for analyzing **ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals** using Python. It focuses on the integration of signal processing and machine learning to automate cardiac diagnostics.

## Overview
The project, supported by the **Vodafone Idea Foundation**, demonstrates how to process raw biomedical data, visualize feature relationships, and debunk common misconceptions about AI's role in healthcare.

## Key Components
* **Signal Processing**: Using **SciPy** for noise filtering and R-peak detection.
* **Feature Visualization**: Implementing **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to plot waveforms and statistical trends.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
    * **Histograms**: Used to visualize **data distribution**.
    * **Scatter Plots**: Used for identifying **bivariate correlation**.
    * **Heatmaps**: Specifically used to **see the correlation** matrix across multiple features.
* **Machine Learning**: Proving the effectiveness of ML in automated ECG analysis (The claim that ML is not used is **False**).



## Prerequisites
The analysis requires the following Python libraries:
* **SciPy**: For filtering and signal manipulation.
* **Matplotlib**: For basic waveform visualization.
* **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical plots and heatmaps.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `ECG_Analysis.ipynb`: Main Google Colab notebook.
* `data/`: Sample ECG datasets.
* `.gitignore`: Standard exclusions for caches and local environments.
